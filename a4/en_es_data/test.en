You know, what I do is write for children,  and I'm probably America's  most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people  that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,  and no one has ever chose farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you  about circles and epiphanies.
And you know, an epiphany  is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
